# Implementing-torch.multinomial-and-autograd
Overview
This repository contains the second assignment for the Deep Learning course, focusing on two key tasks:

Random Sampler Implementation: The first task involved implementing a random sampler for a given discrete distribution. 
Custom Autograd Class: The second task required the creation of a new class that supports several mathematical operations while tracking the derivatives, similar to PyTorch's autograd functionality.
